# devloop: Intelligent Development Workflow Orchestrator

![devloop Logo/Banner (Placeholder)](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300?text=devloop+Logo)

`devloop` is a generic, multi-variant tool designed to streamline development workflows, particularly within Multi-Component Projects (MCPs). It combines functionalities inspired by live-reloading tools like `air` (for Go) and build automation tools like `make`, focusing on intelligent, configuration-driven orchestration of tasks based on file system changes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Install `devloop`**:
    ```bash
    go install
    ```
2.  **Create a `multi.yaml` file in your project's root directory**:
    ```yaml
    rules:
      - name: "Go Backend Build and Run"
        watch:
          - action: "include"
            patterns:
              - "**/*.go"
              - "go.mod"
              - "go.sum"
        commands:
          - "echo 'Building backend...'"
          - "go build -o ./bin/server ./cmd/server"
          - "./bin/server"
    ```
3.  **Run `devloop`**:
    ```bash
    devloop -c multi.yaml
    ```

`devloop` will now watch your files and automatically rebuild and restart your backend server whenever you make changes to your Go code.

## ‚ú® Usefulness as an MCP Tool

`devloop` is especially beneficial in multi-component environments by:

-   Providing a **unified development experience** from a single entry point.
-   Enabling **intelligent, targeted rebuilds/restarts** based on specific file changes, avoiding unnecessary work.
-   Managing **long-running processes** (e.g., backend servers, frontend development servers) with automatic restarts.
-   Offering **simplified configuration** for the entire development environment.
-   Improving **resource efficiency** by only acting on affected components.

## ‚öôÔ∏è `multi.yaml` Configuration Structure

The core of `devloop`'s behavior is defined by `rules` in a `multi.yaml` file. Each rule specifies what files to `watch` and what `commands` to execute when those files change.

```yaml
# multi.yaml example

rules:
  - name: "Go Backend Build and Run" # A unique name for this rule, used for process management
    watch:
      - action: "include"
        patterns:
          - "**/*.go"
          - "go.mod"
          - "go.sum"
    commands:
      - "echo 'Building backend...'"
      - "go build -o ./bin/server ./cmd/server"
      - "./bin/server" # This is a long-running process that devloop will manage

  - name: "Frontend Assets Build" # Another rule for web assets
    watch:
      - action: "include"
        patterns:
          - "web/static/**/*.css"
          - "web/static/**/*.js"
    commands:
      - "echo 'Rebuilding frontend assets...'"
      - "npm run build --prefix web/" # This is a short-lived process

  # ... you can add more rules for WASM, documentation, etc.
```

### Explanation of Fields:

-   `name`: A unique identifier for the rule. Used internally for process management and logging.
-   `watch`: A list of `Matcher` objects. Each `Matcher` has an `action` (`include` or `exclude`) and a list of `patterns`. The `watch` rules are evaluated in order, and the first one to match a file determines the action to take.
-   `commands`: A list of shell commands to execute sequentially when the rule is triggered. These commands are run in a new process group, allowing `devloop` to manage their lifecycle.

## üì¶ Installation

To install `devloop`, ensure you have Go (version 1.20 or higher) installed and your `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$GOBIN`) is in your system's PATH.

```bash
go install
```

This command will compile the `devloop` executable and place it in your Go binary directory, making it globally accessible.

Alternatively, to build the executable locally:

```bash
go build -o devloop
```

## üöÄ Usage

To run `devloop`, navigate to your project's root directory (where your `go.mod` and `multi.yaml` are located) and execute:

```bash
devloop -c multi.yaml
```

-   Use the `-c` flag to specify the path to your `multi.yaml` configuration file. If omitted, `devloop` will look for `multi.yaml` in the current directory.

`devloop` will start watching your files. When changes occur that match your defined rules, it will execute the corresponding commands. You will see log output indicating which rules are triggered and which commands are being run.

To stop `devloop` gracefully, press `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT). `devloop` will attempt to terminate any running child processes before exiting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Status & Roadmap

`devloop` is currently in active development. The core functionalities are implemented and tested:

-   Configuration loading and parsing.
-   File watching and glob matching.
-   Command execution and process management (including termination of previous processes).
-   Debouncing of rapid file change events.
-   CLI argument parsing.
-   Graceful shutdown handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM).

### Next Steps:

-   Further refine error handling and logging for user-friendliness.
-   Explore advanced process management features (e.g., process groups for better child process control).
-   Add more comprehensive documentation and examples.
-   Consider cross-platform compatibility testing.
