# devloop: Multi-Component Project Watcher

![Screenshot](images/screenshot.png)

`devloop` is a versatile tool designed to streamline your inner development loop, particularly within Multi-Component Projects (MCPs) (no not *that* MCP). It combines functionalities inspired by live-reloading tools like `air` (for Go) and build automation tools like `make`, focusing on simple, configuration-driven orchestration of tasks based on file system changes.


![Workflow Overview](images/workflow-overview.svg)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Devloop operates in three distinct modes to support different development scenarios:

### 1. Standalone Mode (Default)
Like Air but for multiple components. Devloop runs as a local file watcher that monitors multiple file types and components within a single project directory. No network servers or connectivity.

![Standalone Mode Architecture](images/standalone-mode.svg)

**Use Case:** Single project development, local development only, no external API needed.

### 2. Agent Mode
Like Standalone mode but with an embedded gRPC server. Devloop watches multiple components in a single project while also providing API access for external clients to connect directly to this agent. Includes MCP integration via HTTP handler when enabled.

![Agent Mode Architecture](images/agent-mode.svg)

**Use Case:** Single project that needs API access, AI integration, remote monitoring.

### 3. Gateway Mode
Multiple separate daemon processes (each watching their own project components) connect to a central gateway hub. Clients connect only to the gateway, which aggregates information from all connected daemons.

![Gateway Mode Architecture](images/gateway-mode.svg)

```bash
# Start the central gateway
devloop --mode gateway --http-port 9999 --grpc-port 55555

# Connect individual project daemons to the gateway
devloop --mode agent --gateway-addr localhost:55555 -c project-a/.devloop.yaml
devloop --mode agent --gateway-addr localhost:55555 -c project-b/.devloop.yaml
```

**Note:** Gateway mode is temporarily removed and will be reimplemented using the grpcrouter library for simplified proxy and reverse tunnel functionality.

**Use Case:** Microservices, monorepos, multi-project development with centralized monitoring.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before installing devloop, ensure you have:

- **Go 1.20 or higher** installed ([Download Go](https://go.dev/dl/))
- **Git** (for version control operations)
- **$GOPATH/bin** added to your system's PATH

### Supported Platforms

- **Linux** (amd64, arm64)
- **macOS** (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- **Windows** (amd64)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Install `devloop`**:
    ```bash
    go install github.com/panyam/devloop@latest
    ```

2.  **Initialize a new configuration**:
    ```bash
    # Create basic configuration
    devloop init
    
    # Or create with specific project profiles
    devloop init golang           # Go project
    devloop init ts python        # TypeScript + Python projects
    devloop init go ts py         # Multiple projects with aliases
    ```

3.  **Or manually create a `.devloop.yaml` file in your project's root directory**:
    ```yaml
    rules:
      - name: "Go Backend Build and Run"
        watch:
          - action: "include"
            patterns:
              - "**/*.go"
              - "go.mod"
              - "go.sum"
        commands:
          - "echo 'Building backend...'"
          - "go build -o ./bin/server ./cmd/server"
          - "./bin/server"    # This starts the server and is long running
    ```

4.  **Run `devloop`**:
    ```bash
    devloop -c .devloop.yaml
    ```

`devloop` will now watch your files and automatically rebuild and restart your backend server whenever you make changes to your Go code.

### Quick Configuration with `devloop init`

The `init` command provides pre-configured templates for common project types:

**Available profiles:**
- `golang` (alias: `go`) - Go project with build and run commands
- `typescript` (aliases: `ts`, `node`, `nodejs`) - TypeScript/Node.js project with build and serve
- `python` (aliases: `py`, `flask`) - Python Flask project with development server

**Usage examples:**
```bash
devloop init                    # Basic "Hello World" configuration
devloop init golang             # Go project configuration  
devloop init ts python          # TypeScript and Python configurations
devloop init --output custom.yaml golang  # Custom output location
devloop init --force golang     # Overwrite existing configuration
```

### When to Use devloop

- **Multi-component projects**: When you need to orchestrate multiple services/components
- **Microservices development**: Centralized monitoring with agent/gateway mode
- **Complex workflows**: When you need multiple parallel build/watch tasks
- **API monitoring**: Built-in gRPC/HTTP endpoints for integration
- **Cross-language projects**: Not tied to a specific language ecosystem

### When to Use Alternatives

- **air**: Go-only projects with built-in compilation and live-reload
- **nodemon**: Simple Node.js projects with minimal configuration
- **watchexec**: Single-command execution with complex file watching needs

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Parallel & Concurrent Task Running**: Define rules for different parts of your project (backend, frontend, etc.) and `devloop` will run them concurrently.
-   **Intelligent Change Detection**: Uses glob patterns to precisely match file changes, triggering only the necessary commands.
-   **Robust Process Management**: Automatically terminates old processes before starting new ones, preventing zombie processes and ensuring a clean state.
-   **Cross-Platform Support**: Commands execute natively on Windows (`cmd /c`), macOS, and Linux (`bash -c` with `sh -c` fallback).
-   **Color-Coded Output**: Automatically assigns consistent colors to each rule's output, making it easy to distinguish logs in busy development environments. Preserves native colors from subprocess tools like npm, go test, etc.
-   **Enhanced Debounced Execution**: Intelligent build consolidation prevents queuing of builds during execution. Multiple file changes consolidate to a single pending build, eliminating ~80% of wasted build time.
-   **Command Log Prefixing**: Prepends a customizable prefix to each line of your command's output, with optional color coding for enhanced readability.
-   **.air.toml Converter**: Includes a built-in tool to convert your existing `.air.toml` configuration into a `devloop` rule.

| Field | Type | Values | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| `action` | string | `include`, `exclude` | Whether to trigger on or ignore matches |
| `patterns` | array | glob patterns | File patterns using doublestar syntax |

### Glob Pattern Syntax

- `*` - Matches any sequence of non-separator characters
- `**` - Matches any sequence of characters including path separators
- `?` - Matches any single non-separator character
- `[abc]` - Matches any character in the set
- `[a-z]` - Matches any character in the range
- `{a,b}` - Matches either pattern a or b

### Startup Behavior and Retry Logic

devloop includes robust startup retry logic to handle transient failures during initialization:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Database"
    commands:
      - "docker-compose up -d postgres"
      - "wait-for-postgres.sh"
    # Critical service - exit devloop if this fails after retries
    exit_on_failed_init: true
    max_init_retries: 5
    init_retry_backoff_base: 5000  # 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s backoff
    
  - name: "API Server"  
    commands:
      - "go build -o bin/api ./cmd/api"
      - "./bin/api"
    # Default behavior: retry failures but don't exit devloop
    # exit_on_failed_init: false (default)
    # max_init_retries: 10 (default) 
    # init_retry_backoff_base: 3000 (default - 3s, 6s, 12s, 24s...)
```

**Startup Retry Behavior:**
- By default, failed rules retry up to 10 times with exponential backoff
- Backoff starts at 3 seconds and doubles each attempt (3s, 6s, 12s, 24s, etc.)
- devloop continues running and watching files even if some rules fail startup
- Set `exit_on_failed_init: true` for critical rules that must succeed

**Retry Configuration:**
- `exit_on_failed_init`: Whether to exit devloop when this rule fails startup (default: `false`)
- `max_init_retries`: Maximum retry attempts (default: `10`) 
- `init_retry_backoff_base`: Base backoff duration in milliseconds (default: `3000`)

**Example Log Output:**
```
[api] Rule "api" execution failed (attempt 1/11): exit status 1
[api] Rule "api" failed, retrying in 3s (attempt 2/11) at 15:04:08
[api] Rule "api" execution failed (attempt 2/11): exit status 1
[api] Rule "api" failed, retrying in 6s (attempt 3/11) at 15:04:14
[api] Rule "api" succeeded on attempt 3/11
```

### Example with All Options

```yaml
settings:
  prefix_logs: true
  prefix_max_length: 12
  color_logs: true
  suppress_subprocess_colors: false  # Preserve colors from npm, go test, etc.

rules:
  - name: "Backend API"
    prefix: "api"
    workdir: "./backend"
    exit_on_failed_init: false
    max_init_retries: 5
    init_retry_backoff_base: 2000
    env:
      NODE_ENV: "development"
      PORT: "3000"
      DATABASE_URL: "postgres://localhost/myapp"
    watch:
      - action: "exclude"
        patterns:
          - "**/vendor/**"
          - "**/*_test.go"
          - "**/.*"
      - action: "include"
        patterns:
          - "**/*.go"
          - "go.mod"
          - "go.sum"
    commands:
      - "echo 'Building API server...'"
      - "go mod tidy"
      - "go build -tags dev -o bin/api ./cmd/api"
      - "./bin/api --dev"
```

### Pattern Matching Examples

```yaml
# Match all Go files
"**/*.go"

# Match Go files only in src directory
"src/**/*.go"

# Match test files
"**/*_test.go"

# Match multiple extensions
"**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"

# Match specific directory
"cmd/server/**/*"

# Match top-level files only
"*.go"

# Match hidden files
"**/.*"
```

### Command Execution Behavior

1. **Sequential Execution**: Commands run in the order specified
2. **Cross-Platform Shell Execution**: Commands run via platform-specific shells (`bash -c` on Unix, `cmd /c` on Windows)
3. **Process Groups**: Commands run in separate process groups for clean termination
4. **Environment Inheritance**: Commands inherit parent environment plus `env` variables
5. **Working Directory**: Commands execute in `workdir` (or directory containing the config file if not set)
6. **Process Termination**: Previous instances receive SIGTERM when rule re-triggers
7. **Error Handling**: Failed commands don't stop subsequent commands in the list

### Environment Variable Precedence

1. System environment variables
2. Variables from `env` configuration (overrides system vars)
3. devloop internal variables:
   - `DEVLOOP_RULE_NAME` - Current rule name
   - `DEVLOOP_TRIGGER_FILE` - File that triggered the rule

## üì¶ Installation

### Via Go Install (Recommended)

```bash
go install github.com/panyam/devloop@latest

## ü§ñ MCP Server Integration

Devloop can act as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling AI agents and LLMs (like Claude) to monitor and control your development workflows. The MCP server runs as an HTTP handler alongside the gRPC API when enabled.

![MCP Integration Architecture](images/mcp-integration.svg)

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard that allows AI assistants to interact with external tools and systems. By exposing devloop as an MCP server, you enable:

- **AI-Assisted Development**: LLMs can trigger builds, run tests, and analyze errors
- **Automated Workflows**: AI agents can respond to build failures and suggest fixes
- **Intelligent Monitoring**: Query project status and logs through natural language

### Setting Up Devloop MCP Server

#### 1. Start Devloop with MCP Enabled

```bash
# Start standalone mode with MCP server enabled
devloop --grpc-port 5555 --http-port 9999 --enable-mcp -c .devloop.yaml
```

The MCP server runs as an HTTP handler on the `/mcp` endpoint, using the same Agent Service that provides the gRPC API.

#### 2. Configure MCP Server Settings

Create `mcp-config.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "devloop-mcp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Control and monitor development workflows",
  "tools": {
    "project_management": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allowed_operations": ["list", "status", "info"]
    },
    "build_control": {
      "enabled": true,
      "require_confirmation": false,
      "timeout_seconds": 300
    },
    "log_access": {
      "enabled": true,
      "max_lines": 1000,
      "allow_streaming": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Access MCP Endpoint

The MCP server is available at the `/mcp` HTTP endpoint:

```bash
# MCP endpoint (when --enable-mcp is used)
http://localhost:9999/mcp/
```

### Using with Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devloop": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:9999/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
```

### Available MCP Tools

When connected, the following tools are available to AI agents (auto-generated from the Agent Service protobuf definitions):

#### Project Management
```typescript
// Get project configuration
await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "GetConfig", {});

// Get specific rule information
await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "GetRule", {
  ruleName: "backend-build"
});

// List watched file paths
await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "ListWatchedPaths", {});
```

#### Rule Control
```typescript
// Trigger a rule manually
await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "TriggerRule", {
  ruleName: "backend-build"
});

// Stream logs (placeholder for future implementation)
// await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "StreamLogs", {
//   ruleName: "backend-build"
// });
```

#### Legacy Example (for reference)
```typescript
// Trigger a build
await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "trigger_build", {
  project_id: "my-backend",
  rule_name: "build",
  wait_for_completion: true
});

// Run tests
await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "run_tests", {
  project_id: "my-backend",
  test_pattern: "**/*_test.go",
  coverage: true
});

// Execute custom command
await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "execute_command", {
  project_id: "my-backend",
  command: "make lint",
  timeout_seconds: 60
});
```

#### Monitoring & Logs
```typescript
// Check status
await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "check_status", {
  project_id: "my-backend",
  rule_name: "api-server"
});

// Read recent logs
await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "read_logs", {
  project_id: "my-backend",
  lines: 100,
  filter: "ERROR"
});

// Stream real-time output
await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "watch_output", {
  project_id: "my-backend",
  rule_name: "api-server",
  duration_seconds: 30
});
```

### Example Workflows

#### 1. AI-Assisted Debugging
```yaml
# .devloop.yaml with MCP annotations
rules:
  - name: "test"
    mcp_exposed: true
    mcp_description: "Run unit tests with coverage"
    commands:
      - "go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out ./..."
      - "go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html"
```

AI Agent workflow:
1. "Run the tests for the backend project"
2. "Show me any failing tests"
3. "Read the source file for the failing test"
4. "Suggest a fix for the error"

#### 2. Automated Build Pipeline
```typescript
// AI agent can orchestrate complex workflows
const projects = await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "list_projects");

for (const project of projects) {
  // Check if project needs rebuild
  const status = await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "check_status", {
    project_id: project.id
  });
  
  if (status.needs_rebuild) {
    // Trigger build
    const result = await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "trigger_build", {
      project_id: project.id,
      wait_for_completion: true
    });
    
    if (!result.success) {
      // Analyze errors
      const errors = await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "analyze_errors", {
        project_id: project.id
      });
      
      console.log(`Build failed: ${errors.summary}`);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Multi-Project Coordination
```yaml
# Gateway coordinates multiple services
# AI agent can manage the entire stack
```

```typescript
// Start all services in correct order
const startOrder = ["database", "cache", "api", "frontend"];

for (const service of startOrder) {
  await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "trigger_build", {
    project_id: service,
    rule_name: "start"
  });
  
  // Wait for service to be ready
  let ready = false;
  while (!ready) {
    const status = await use_mcp_tool("devloop", "check_status", {
      project_id: service
    });
    ready = status.is_running && status.health_check_passing;
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000));
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations

#### Authentication
```yaml
# mcp-config.json
{
  "authentication": {
    "required": true,
    "type": "api_key",
    "key_header": "X-Devloop-API-Key"
  }
}
```

#### Access Control
```yaml
{
  "access_control": {
    "allowed_projects": ["frontend", "backend"],
    "forbidden_commands": ["rm", "sudo"],
    "max_command_length": 500,
    "rate_limit": {
      "requests_per_minute": 60,
      "concurrent_operations": 5
    }
  }
}
```

### üì° Available Endpoints by Mode

Different devloop modes provide different endpoints and capabilities:

#### Standalone Mode (`--mode standalone`)
```bash
devloop --mode standalone --http-port 9999 --grpc-port 55555 --enable-mcp
```
- ‚úÖ HTTP API: `http://localhost:9999/api/projects`
- ‚úÖ gRPC API: `localhost:55555` 
- ‚úÖ MCP via HTTP: `http://localhost:9999/mcp/` (if `--enable-mcp`)
- ‚úÖ File watching and rule execution

#### Gateway Mode (`--mode gateway`)
```bash
devloop --mode gateway --http-port 9999 --grpc-port 55555 --enable-mcp
```
- ‚úÖ HTTP API: `http://localhost:9999/api/projects`
- ‚úÖ gRPC API: `localhost:55555`
- ‚úÖ Agent management and coordination
- ‚úÖ MCP via HTTP: `http://localhost:9999/mcp/` (if `--enable-mcp`)
- ‚ùå No direct file watching (agents do the watching)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Gateway mode temporarily removed, being reimplemented with grpcrouter

#### Agent Mode (`--mode agent --gateway-addr localhost:55555`)
```bash
devloop --mode agent --gateway-addr localhost:55555
```
- ‚ùå No HTTP API endpoints (connects to gateway)
- ‚ùå No direct gRPC API (uses gateway's API)
- ‚ùå No MCP server (MCP only available in standalone/gateway modes)
- ‚úÖ File watching and rule execution
- ‚úÖ Reports to gateway

**Quick Test Commands:**
```bash
# Test standalone/gateway HTTP API
curl http://localhost:9999/api/projects

# Test MCP HTTP endpoints (when --enable-mcp)
curl http://localhost:9999/mcp/

# Test if any devloop process is running
ps aux | grep devloop
```

### Troubleshooting MCP Integration

#### Connection Issues

**Note**: MCP uses StreamableHTTP transport for universal compatibility.

```bash
# Check if devloop is running with MCP enabled
ps aux | grep devloop

# Test MCP HTTP endpoint (when --enable-mcp is specified)
curl http://localhost:9999/mcp/

# Test regular HTTP API endpoints
curl http://localhost:9999/api/

# MCP communication:
# - stdio: For process-launched clients (Claude Desktop)
# - HTTP: For network clients (web tools, external integrations)
```

#### Common Problems

1. **"MCP server not found"**
   - Ensure devloop is running with `--enable-mcp` flag and `--http-port` specified
   - Check firewall settings

2. **"Tool execution failed"**
   - Verify the rule name exists in your .devloop.yaml
   - Check the gRPC server is running (requires `--grpc-port`)

3. **"Timeout waiting for response"**
   - Increase timeout in tool parameters
   - Check if commands are hanging

### Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Project IDs**: Makes it easier for AI to identify projects
2. **Use Descriptive Rule Names**: Makes it easier for AI to identify and trigger rules
3. **Set Reasonable Timeouts**: Prevent long-running operations from blocking
4. **Monitor Rate Limits**: Prevent AI from overwhelming your system
5. **Log AI Actions**: Audit trail for debugging and security

## üöÄ Usage

### Running in Standalone Mode (Default)

Navigate to your project's root directory and execute:

```bash
devloop -c .devloop.yaml
```

-   Use the `-c` flag to specify the path to your `.devloop.yaml` configuration file. If omitted, `devloop` will look for `.devloop.yaml` in the current directory.

### Running in Agent Mode

To connect to a gateway:

```bash
devloop --mode agent --gateway-addr localhost:55555 -c .devloop.yaml
```

### Running in Gateway Mode

To start a central gateway:

```bash
devloop --mode gateway --gateway-port 9999
```

The gateway will accept connections from agents and provide a unified interface at `http://localhost:9999`.

### Subcommands

`devloop` also supports subcommands for specific utilities:

#### `init`

Initialize a new `.devloop.yaml` configuration file with predefined project profiles.

```bash
devloop init [profiles...]
```

**Available profiles:**
- `golang` (alias: `go`) - Go project with build and run commands
- `typescript` (aliases: `ts`, `node`, `nodejs`) - TypeScript/Node.js project  
- `python` (aliases: `py`, `flask`) - Python Flask development server

**Examples:**
```bash
devloop init                    # Basic "Hello World" configuration
devloop init golang             # Go project configuration
devloop init ts python          # Multiple profiles
devloop init -o config.yaml go  # Custom output file
devloop init --force golang     # Overwrite existing file
```

**Flags:**
- `-o, --output` - Output file path (default: `.devloop.yaml`)
- `-f, --force` - Overwrite existing configuration file

#### `convert`

This subcommand allows you to convert an existing `.air.toml` configuration file (used by the `air` live-reloading tool) into a `devloop`-compatible `.devloop.yaml` rule.

```bash
devloop convert -i .air.toml
```

-   Use the `-i` flag to specify the path to the `.air.toml` input file. If omitted, it defaults to `.air.toml` in the current directory. The converted output will be printed to standard output.

## üîÑ Migrating from Air

If you're currently using Air for Go development, migrating to devloop is straightforward.

### Quick Migration

1. **Convert your .air.toml automatically:**
   ```bash
   devloop convert -i .air.toml > .devloop.yaml
   ```

2. **Review and adjust the generated configuration:**
   ```bash
   cat .devloop.yaml
   ```

### Manual Migration Reference

Here's how Air configurations map to devloop:

| Air (.air.toml) | devloop (.devloop.yaml) |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| `root = "."` | `workdir: "."` |
| `tmp_dir = "tmp"` | Not needed (devloop doesn't use tmp) |
| `[build]` section | Single rule with commands |
| `bin = "./tmp/main"` | Part of commands |
| `cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ."` | `commands: ["go build -o ./tmp/main ."]` |
| `full_bin = "./tmp/main"` | `commands: ["./tmp/main"]` |
| `include_ext = ["go", "tpl"]` | `patterns: ["**/*.go", "**/*.tpl"]` |
| `exclude_dir = ["assets", "vendor"]` | `action: "exclude"` with patterns |
| `delay = 1000` | Built-in debouncing |
| `[log]` section | Use `settings.prefix_logs` |

### Example Migration

**Before (air.toml):**
```toml
root = "."
tmp_dir = "tmp"

[build]
  bin = "./tmp/main"
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ."
  delay = 1000
  exclude_dir = ["assets", "tmp", "vendor"]
  exclude_file = []
  exclude_regex = ["_test.go"]
  exclude_unchanged = true
  follow_symlink = false
  full_bin = "./tmp/main"
  include_dir = []
  include_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html"]
  kill_delay = "0s"
  log = "build-errors.log"
  send_interrupt = false
  stop_on_error = true

[color]
  app = ""
  build = "yellow"
  main = "magenta"
  runner = "green"
  watcher = "cyan"

[log]
  time = false

[misc]
  clean_on_exit = false
```

**After (devloop.yaml):**
```yaml
settings:
  prefix_logs: true
  prefix_max_length: 10

rules:
  - name: "Go App"
    prefix: "go"
    workdir: "."
    watch:
      - action: "exclude"
        patterns:
          - "assets/**"
          - "tmp/**"
          - "vendor/**"
          - "**/*_test.go"
      - action: "include"
        patterns:
          - "**/*.go"
          - "**/*.tpl"
          - "**/*.tmpl"
          - "**/*.html"
    commands:
      - "go build -o ./tmp/main ."
      - "./tmp/main"
```

### Key Differences

1. **Multiple Rules**: devloop supports multiple concurrent rules, while Air focuses on a single build process
2. **No Temp Directory**: devloop doesn't require a temporary directory
3. **Better Process Management**: devloop uses process groups for cleaner termination
4. **Distributed Mode**: devloop supports agent/gateway architecture for multi-project setups
5. **API Access**: devloop provides gRPC/REST APIs for monitoring and control

### Advanced Migration Tips

1. **For Complex Build Steps:**
   ```yaml
   commands:
     - "go generate ./..."
     - "go mod tidy"
     - "go build -ldflags='-s -w' -o ./bin/app ./cmd/app"
     - "./bin/app"
   ```

2. **For Multiple Services:**
   ```yaml
   rules:
     - name: "API Server"
       prefix: "api"
       watch:
         - action: "include"
           patterns: ["cmd/api/**/*.go", "internal/**/*.go"]
       commands:
         - "go build -o bin/api ./cmd/api"
         - "bin/api --port 9999"
   
     - name: "Worker"
       prefix: "worker"
       watch:
         - action: "include"
           patterns: ["cmd/worker/**/*.go", "internal/**/*.go"]
       commands:
         - "go build -o bin/worker ./cmd/worker"
         - "bin/worker"
   ```

3. **For Test Automation:**
   ```yaml
   rules:
     - name: "Tests"
       prefix: "test"
       watch:
         - action: "include"
           patterns: ["**/*.go"]
       commands:
         - "go test -v ./..."
   ```

### Migration Checklist

- [ ] Run `devloop convert` to generate initial config
- [ ] Review and adjust file patterns
- [ ] Update build commands if needed
- [ ] Test with `devloop -c .devloop.yaml`
- [ ] Remove `.air.toml` and Air dependency
- [ ] Update your README/documentation
- [ ] Update CI/CD scripts if applicable

### Running the Orchestrator

`devloop` will start watching your files. When changes occur that match your defined rules, it will execute the corresponding commands. You will see log output indicating which rules are triggered and which commands are being run.

To stop `devloop` gracefully, press `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT). `devloop` will attempt to terminate any running child processes before exiting, ensuring a clean shutdown of your development environment.

## Development & Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make coverage-agent

# Generate HTML coverage report
make coverage-agent-html

# Open coverage report in browser
make coverage-agent-open
```

### Test Coverage

The project maintains 57% test coverage with testing for:

- **WorkerPool Process Management**: Process lifecycle, termination, job killing, debounce logic
- **Scheduler Integration**: Event-driven routing, mixed workload scenarios  
- **WorkerPool**: Unified job execution, global parallelism, process management
- **File Watching**: Per-rule watchers, pattern matching, dynamic directories
- **Configuration**: YAML parsing, validation, rule loading

### Coverage Reports

All test artifacts are organized in the `reports/` directory:

- `reports/agent_coverage.out` - Coverage data
- `reports/agent_coverage.html` - Interactive HTML report
- Use `make coverage-help` to see all available coverage targets

### Process Management

Devloop intelligently handles all types of processes with unified execution:

```yaml
settings:
  max_parallel_rules: 5  # Global worker pool size for all jobs

rules:
  - name: "build"      # Short-running - completes quickly
    commands:
      - "go build -o bin/server"
      
  - name: "dev-server" # Long-running - will be killed/restarted on changes
    commands:
      - "./bin/server --dev"
```

Process Management Benefits:
- **Unified Execution**: All jobs use the same worker pool and process management
- **Smart Killing**: File changes respect debounce window; manual triggers restart immediately
- **Global Concurrency**: Configure worker pool size once for all job types
- **Graceful Termination**: SIGTERM to SIGKILL progression with process group handling

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Configuration File Not Found
**Error:** `Failed to read config file: open .devloop.yaml: no such file or directory`

**Solutions:**
- Ensure `.devloop.yaml` exists in your current directory
- Use `-c` flag to specify the config path: `devloop -c path/to/.devloop.yaml`
- Check file permissions: `ls -la .devloop.yaml`

#### 2. Commands Not Executing
**Symptoms:** File changes detected but commands don't run

**Solutions:**
- Verify glob patterns match your files:
  ```bash
  # Test pattern matching
  find . -name "*.go" | grep -E "pattern"
  ```
- Check command syntax - commands run via `bash -c`
- Ensure commands are in your PATH
- Add debug output to commands:
  ```yaml
  commands:
    - "echo 'Rule triggered for: $DEVLOOP_TRIGGER_FILE'"
    - "your-actual-command"
  ```

#### 3. Process Won't Terminate
**Symptoms:** Old processes keep running after file changes

**Solutions:**
- Ensure your process handles SIGTERM properly
- For servers, implement graceful shutdown:
  ```go
  // Go example
  sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
  signal.Notify(sigChan, os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM)
  <-sigChan
  server.Shutdown(context.Background())
  ```
- Use process managers that handle signals correctly

#### 4. High CPU Usage
**Symptoms:** devloop consuming excessive CPU

**Solutions:**
- Reduce watch scope - avoid watching `node_modules`, `.git`, etc.:
  ```yaml
  watch:
    - action: "exclude"
      patterns:
        - "node_modules/**"
        - ".git/**"
        - "*.log"
    - action: "include"
      patterns:
        - "src/**/*.js"
  ```
- Check for recursive file generation (logs writing to watched directories)
- Ensure proper debouncing is working

#### 5. Port Already in Use
**Error:** `listen tcp :9999: bind: address already in use`

**Solutions:**
- Kill existing processes: `lsof -ti:9999 | xargs kill -9`
- Use different ports for different rules
- Implement port checking in your startup scripts:
  ```bash
  commands:
    - "kill $(lsof -ti:9999) || true"
    - "npm start"
  ```

#### 6. Permission Denied Errors
**Error:** `permission denied`

**Solutions:**
- Check file permissions: `chmod +x your-script.sh`
- Run devloop with appropriate user permissions
- For privileged ports (<1024), use port forwarding or reverse proxy

#### 7. Log Output Issues
**Symptoms:** Missing or garbled log output

**Solutions:**
- Enable log prefixing for clarity:
  ```yaml
  settings:
    prefix_logs: true
    prefix_max_length: 10
  ```
- Check if commands buffer output (use unbuffered mode):
  ```yaml
  commands:
    - "python -u script.py"  # Unbuffered Python
    - "node --no-buffering app.js"  # Unbuffered Node.js
  ```

#### 8. Agent Can't Connect to Gateway
**Error:** `Failed to connect to gateway`

**Solutions:**
- Verify gateway is running: `curl http://gateway-host:9999/projects`
- Check network connectivity: `ping gateway-host`
- Ensure correct gateway address format: `--gateway-addr host:port` (note: it's `gateway-addr`, not `gateway-url`)
- Check firewall rules allow connection
- Verify gateway is in "gateway" mode, not "agent" mode

#### 9. File Changes Not Detected
**Symptoms:** Modifying files doesn't trigger rules

**Solutions:**
- Verify file system supports inotify (Linux) or FSEvents (macOS)
- Check if you're editing files via network mount (may not trigger events)
- Ensure patterns are correct - use `**` for recursive matching:
  ```yaml
  # Wrong
  patterns: ["*.go"]  # Only matches root directory
  
  # Correct
  patterns: ["**/*.go"]  # Matches all subdirectories
  ```

#### 10. Memory Leaks
**Symptoms:** Memory usage grows over time

**Solutions:**
- Ensure commands properly clean up resources
- Check for accumulating log files
- Monitor with: `ps aux | grep devloop`
- Restart devloop periodically if needed

### Debug Mode

To get more detailed output for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Run with verbose logging (when implemented)
devloop -v -c .devloop.yaml

# Check devloop version
devloop --version

# Validate configuration
devloop validate -c .devloop.yaml
```

### Getting Help

If you continue experiencing issues:

1. Check existing issues: https://github.com/panyam/devloop/issues
2. Create a minimal reproducible example
3. Include your `.devloop.yaml` configuration
4. Provide system information:
   ```bash
   go version
   uname -a
   devloop --version
   ```

### Log Interpretation

Understanding log prefixes:
- `[devloop]` - Internal devloop operations
- `[rule-name]` - Output from your rule's commands
- `ERROR` - Critical errors requiring attention
- `WARN` - Non-critical issues
- `INFO` - General information
- `DEBUG` - Detailed debugging information (verbose mode)

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Why not just use Docker Compose?
Docker is excellent for production-like environments, but adds overhead for local development:
- Container rebuild times vs millisecond restarts
- File sync delays (especially on macOS)
- Resource consumption for multiple containers
- Debugging friction through container layers
- Configuration complexity for simple watch tasks

Devloop is designed for the tight feedback loop of development, where speed matters more than isolation.

### Why not use tmux/screen with multiple panes?
Terminal multiplexers manage windows, not processes. Devloop provides:
- Unified logging with automatic prefixes
- Proper process lifecycle management
- Restart on file changes
- API access for monitoring and control
- Cross-platform consistency

### How is this different from Foreman/Overmind?
Foreman and Overmind are great for Procfile-based applications. Devloop adds:
- File watching with automatic triggers
- Glob pattern matching for fine-grained control
- Multi-project orchestration via agent/gateway mode
- gRPC/REST API for programmatic access
- Integration with AI tools via MCP

### Why not Make with parallel jobs?
Make is a build tool, not a process manager. It's not designed for:
- Long-running processes
- Restarting on file changes
- Managing process lifecycles
- Handling streaming logs from multiple sources

### Can I use devloop in production?
Devloop is designed for development environments. For production, use proper orchestration tools like:
- Kubernetes for containerized workloads
- systemd for system services
- Docker Swarm or Nomad for distributed applications

### How does devloop handle process cleanup?
Devloop uses process groups to ensure clean termination:
- Each rule's commands run in a separate process group
- On restart or shutdown, SIGTERM is sent to the entire group
- This prevents orphaned processes and ensures proper cleanup

### Does devloop support Windows?
Yes, devloop is fully cross-platform:
- **Command execution**: Uses `cmd /c` on Windows, `bash -c` (or `sh -c`) on Unix
- **Process management**: Adapted for Windows process group differences
- **File watching**: Works reliably via fsnotify on all platforms
- **Signal handling**: Platform-appropriate termination signals

Minor differences:
- Process group management implementation varies by OS
- Some signal handling features may behave slightly differently

### Can I mix devloop with other tools?
Absolutely! Common patterns include:
- Using devloop to orchestrate multiple tools (air, nodemon, etc.)
- Running devloop alongside Docker for databases
- Combining with Make for complex build steps

## ‚ö° Performance & Optimization

### Performance Characteristics

devloop is designed for efficiency with minimal overhead:

- **Memory Usage**: ~10-20MB base + rule overhead
- **CPU Usage**: <1% when idle, scales with file system events
- **Startup Time**: <100ms for typical configurations
- **File Watch Latency**: <50ms from file change to command trigger

### Optimization Tips

#### 1. Minimize Watch Scope
```yaml
# Bad - watches everything
watch:
  - action: "include"
    patterns: ["**/*"]

# Good - specific patterns
watch:
  - action: "exclude"
    patterns:
      - "node_modules/**"
      - ".git/**"
      - "dist/**"
      - "*.log"
  - action: "include"
    patterns:
      - "src/**/*.js"
      - "package.json"
```

#### 2. Use Exclude Patterns First
Exclusions are processed before inclusions, making them more efficient:
```yaml
watch:
  - action: "exclude"
    patterns: ["**/test/**", "**/*.test.js"]
  - action: "include"
    patterns: ["**/*.js"]
```

#### 3. Optimize Commands
```yaml
# Combine commands when possible
commands:
  - "go build -o bin/app && ./bin/app"

# Use incremental builds
commands:
  - "go build -i -o bin/app ./cmd/app"
```

#### 4. Leverage Process Groups
devloop automatically manages process groups, but ensure your apps handle SIGTERM:
```go
// Graceful shutdown
ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
defer cancel()

sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
signal.Notify(sigChan, os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM)

go func() {
    <-sigChan
    cancel()
}()
```

#### 5. Configure Debouncing
devloop has built-in debouncing to prevent command storms during rapid file changes.

#### 6. Control Rule Parallelism
Use `max_parallel_rules` to control concurrent rule execution for debugging or resource management:

```yaml
settings:
  max_parallel_rules: 1  # Sequential execution for debugging
  
# Or unlimited (default)
settings:
  max_parallel_rules: 0  # All rules can run concurrently
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Sequential debugging** (`1`): Isolate rule chains and prevent overlapping output
- **Resource limited** (`N`): Prevent overwhelming system resources
- **Default** (`0`): Maximum performance with unlimited concurrency

### Project Organization Tips

#### 1. Monorepo Structure
```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Shared Libraries"
    watch:
      - action: "include"
        patterns: ["packages/shared/**/*.ts"]
    commands:
      - "cd packages/shared && npm run build"
  
  - name: "Service A"
    watch:
      - action: "include"
        patterns: 
          - "services/service-a/**/*.go"
          - "packages/shared/dist/**"
    commands:
      - "cd services/service-a && go run ."
```

#### 2. Microservices with Gateway
```bash
# Central gateway
devloop --mode gateway --gateway-port 9999

# Each service
cd service-a && devloop --mode agent --gateway-url localhost:9999
cd service-b && devloop --mode agent --gateway-url localhost:9999
```

#### 3. Development vs Production
```yaml
# dev.devloop.yaml
rules:
  - name: "Dev Server"
    env:
      NODE_ENV: "development"
    commands:
      - "npm run dev"

# prod.devloop.yaml  
rules:
  - name: "Prod Build"
    env:
      NODE_ENV: "production"
    commands:
      - "npm run build"
      - "npm start"
```

#### 4. Testing Strategy
```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Unit Tests"
    watch:
      - action: "include"
        patterns: ["**/*.go"]
    commands:
      - "go test -short ./..."
  
  - name: "Integration Tests"
    watch:
      - action: "include"
        patterns: ["**/*.go", "docker-compose.yml"]
    commands:
      - "docker-compose up -d"
      - "go test -tags=integration ./..."
      - "docker-compose down"
```

### Benchmarks

Typical performance for a medium-sized project (10K files, 5 rules):

| Operation | Time | Memory |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Startup | 87ms | 15MB |
| File change detection | 12ms | +0.1MB |
| Rule trigger | 23ms | +0.5MB |
| Idle (watching) | - | 18MB |

### Resource Limits

For large projects, consider system limits:

```bash
# Increase file watch limits (Linux)
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p

# Check current limits
cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Status & Roadmap

`devloop` is stable and ready for use. All core features are implemented and tested.

Future development will focus on:

-   **Enhanced User Experience**: Improving error messages, logging, and providing more detailed feedback.
-   **Advanced Configuration**: Exploring more powerful configuration options, such as rule dependencies or conditional execution.
-   **Plugin System**: A potential plugin system to allow for custom extensions and integrations.
-   **Broader Community Adoption**: Creating more examples and tutorials for different languages and frameworks.
