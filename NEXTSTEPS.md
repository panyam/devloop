# Devloop Next Steps

This document outlines the immediate next steps for the `devloop` project.

## Recently Completed (2025-07-02)

- ✅ **Fixed All Failing Tests:** Successfully resolved all test failures including:
  - `orchestrator_test.go` - Fixed config file path resolution after code reorganization
  - `graceful_shutdown_test.go` - Fixed file watcher initialization from project root
  - `log_manager_test.go` - Fixed channel signaling for rule start events
  - `e2e_test.go` - Fixed output file path issues in test commands
  - Fixed grpc.Dial deprecation warning by migrating to grpc.NewClient
  
- ✅ **Improved Glob Pattern Matching:** 
  - Switched from `gobwas/glob` to `bmatcuk/doublestar` library
  - Now follows standard glob conventions where `**` matches zero or more directories
  - Pattern `src/**/*.go` now correctly matches both `src/main.go` AND `src/pkg/utils.go`
  
- ✅ **Code Reorganization:**
  - Moved all Go files (except main.go) into `agent/` directory
  - Updated all import paths and test references accordingly
  - All tests pass after reorganization

## High Priority

- **Finalize Agent/Gateway Implementation:**
  - Implement the client logic in `agent` mode for registering with and sending data to the gateway
  - Implement the aggregation and proxying logic in the `gateway` mode to handle multiple agents
  - Add comprehensive tests for distributed mode operations

- **Add gRPC API Tests:** Create a new suite of tests specifically for the gRPC and HTTP endpoints to ensure the API is robust and reliable

## Medium Priority

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Profile the file watching and command execution pipeline
  - Optimize debouncing logic for large numbers of file changes
  - Consider implementing command queuing for better resource management

- **Enhanced Configuration:**
  - Add support for environment-specific configurations
  - Implement configuration validation and better error messages
  - Consider adding a configuration wizard for new users

## Ongoing

- **Documentation:** Update all project documentation (README, etc.) to reflect:
  - The new gRPC-based architecture and the three operating modes
  - The glob pattern behavior with doublestar
  - The new `agent/` directory structure
  
- **User Experience:** 
  - Refine the CLI flags and output for the new modes to ensure they are clear and intuitive
  - Add better progress indicators for long-running commands
  - Improve error messages and debugging information
