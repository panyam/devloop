# Devloop Next Steps

This document outlines the immediate next steps for the `devloop` project.

## High Priority

- **Graceful Shutdown:** Implement handling of OS signals (SIGINT/SIGTERM) to ensure the tool and its child processes terminate cleanly.

## Ongoing

- **Documentation:** Continue to improve and expand project documentation.
- **Testing:** Add more comprehensive tests, especially for edge cases and complex scenarios.
