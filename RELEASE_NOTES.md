# Devloop Release Notes

## v0.0.80 (2025-08-29)

### Simplified Architecture & Enhanced Status Tracking

**Major Architectural Simplification**
- **Replaced callback-based triggers with channel-based event loop** - Eliminated complex callback chains and multiple trigger methods
- **Removed scheduler and worker complexity** - Direct execution in RuleRunner for cleaner code paths
- **Channel-driven event handling** - File changes → channels → execution with proper Go concurrency patterns
- **Unified process management** - Single execution flow with proper status tracking

**Enhanced Status & Error Tracking**
- **Improved protobuf field names** for clarity:
  - `start_time` → `last_started` (when most recent execution started)
  - `last_build_time` → `last_finished` (when most recent execution finished) 
- **Added `last_error` field** to RuleStatus - Captures actual error messages from failed executions
- **Real-time status updates** - Proper "RUNNING" → "SUCCESS"/"FAILED" status transitions
- **Enhanced status display** - `devloop status` now shows detailed error information

**Event Flow Simplification**
```
Old: File Change → Callback → TriggerDebounced → Complex Timer Logic → Scheduler → Worker
New: File Change → fileChangeChan → handleFileChangeEvent → timerChan → executeNow
```

**Breaking Changes**
- Removed LRO (Long-Running Operations) distinction - all rules now execute directly
- Removed `lro: true/false` configuration flag - no longer needed
- Test interfaces changed from internal method access to channel-based behavior testing

## v0.0.70 (2025-08-20)

### LRO (Long-Running Operations) Architecture

**Architectural Changes**
- **Problem**: Long-running processes (dev servers, databases) were consuming worker semaphore slots indefinitely, blocking short-running jobs (builds, tests)
- **Solution**: Implemented dual-execution architecture with job routing based on `lro: true/false` flag
- **Result**: Dev servers can run indefinitely while builds/tests execute in parallel without resource starvation

**New Components**
- **Scheduler**: Event-driven routing component that receives TriggerEvents and routes to appropriate execution engines
- **LROManager**: Process lifecycle manager with process replacement and graceful termination
- **ProcessManager**: Process tree cleanup with SIGTERM to SIGKILL progression and process group verification
- **TriggerEvent**: Messaging system decoupling RuleRunner from execution concerns

**Configuration Changes**
```yaml
rules:
  - name: "build"
    lro: false  # Short-running - uses WorkerPool with semaphore
    commands:
      - "go build -o bin/server"
      
  - name: "dev-server"
    lro: true   # Long-running - uses LROManager, unlimited concurrency
    commands:
      - "./bin/server --dev"
```

**Implementation Details**
- LRO processes run with unlimited concurrency
- File changes trigger process kill and restart cycle with process tree cleanup
- RuleRunner handles watching/debouncing, Scheduler handles routing, Execution engines handle running
- Single source of truth for rule execution state via callback architecture
- Default `lro: false` maintains existing behavior

### Testing Infrastructure

**Test Coverage**
- 57% test coverage with LRO lifecycle and integration tests
- Process cleanup tests for process tree termination and race conditions
- Integration tests for scheduler routing and mixed workload scenarios

**Developer Tools**
- Makefile coverage targets: `make coverage-agent-html`, `make coverage-open`
- Test artifacts organized in `reports/` directory with HTML output
- Test categories: LRO tests, scheduler tests, stress tests

### Process Management

**Process Cleanup**
- Process group termination with proper SIGTERM to SIGKILL progression
- Mutex protection preventing multiple processes for same rule
- 5-second grace period before force termination
- Process verification ensuring complete process tree cleanup

## v0.0.60 (2025-08-01)

### 🚀 Enhanced Debouncing System

**Intelligent Build Consolidation**
- **Fixed**: Critical issue where multiple file edits during long builds would queue up multiple executions
- **Before**: 10 edits during 20s build = 10 queued builds (200s total)
- **After**: 10 edits during 20s build = 1 active + 1 pending (40s total)
- **Benefit**: ~80% reduction in wasted build time for rapidly changing files

**Smart Execution Management**
- Multiple triggers during rule execution now consolidate to single pending execution
- Only the most recent file changes trigger the final build
- No more wasteful intermediate builds from outdated file changes
- Thread-safe pending execution state management with proper mutex protection

**Enhanced Logging**
- Verbose mode shows when triggers are consolidated vs queued
- Clear visibility into debouncing decisions and pending execution replacements
- Better debugging for build timing and trigger behavior

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes & Improvements

**Configuration Parsing**
- Fixed `prefix_max_length` YAML parsing that was preventing proper prefix padding
- Prefix alignment now works correctly (e.g., `[prefix    ] output`)

**Test Infrastructure**
- Fixed `TestGracefulShutdown` by removing obsolete `--mode` CLI flag
- Fixed `TestPrefixing` with proper prefix length configuration parsing
- Added comprehensive test coverage for new debouncing behavior

### Configuration Example

```yaml
settings:
  default_debounce_delay: "500ms"  # Smart debouncing now prevents build queuing
  verbose: true                    # See debouncing decisions in logs
  
rules:
  - name: "frontend"
    commands:
      - "npm run build"  # Long builds no longer queue up!
```

**Result**: Developers experience dramatically faster feedback loops with no wasted build cycles.

## v0.0.59 (2025-08-01)

### 🎨 Enhanced Color Management

**Subprocess Color Preservation**
- **Fixed**: Devloop no longer suppresses colors from subprocess output
- **Before**: Tools like `npm build`, `go test`, etc. appeared in black and white
- **After**: Full color preservation - npm errors show in red, success messages in green
- **Benefit**: Significantly improved developer experience with native tool colors

**New Configuration Option**
- Added `suppress_subprocess_colors: false` (default) to settings
- Set to `true` to disable subprocess colors if preferred
- Backwards compatible - existing configs work unchanged

**Technical Improvements**
- Decoupled devloop prefix colors from subprocess color control
- Enhanced ANSI color code handling with proper regex patterns
- Added environment variables for subprocess color detection (`FORCE_COLOR`, `CLICOLOR_FORCE`, `COLORTERM`)
- Terminal output preserves colors, file logs remain clean without ANSI codes
- Comprehensive test coverage for color preservation functionality

### Configuration Example

```yaml
settings:
  color_logs: true                     # Enable devloop prefix colors
  suppress_subprocess_colors: false    # Preserve subprocess colors (default)
  
rules:
  - name: "frontend"
    commands:
      - "npm run build"    # Now shows colored output!
```

**Result**: Devloop prefixes stay colored (`[frontend]` in blue) while npm output shows its native colors (errors in red, success in green).
